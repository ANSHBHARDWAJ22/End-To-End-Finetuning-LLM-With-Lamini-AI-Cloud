# 🔧 Lamini Fine-Tuning Guide

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with Lamini AI Cloud allows you to customize LLMs to perform better on your domain-specific tasks. This guide walks you through what it is, why it’s useful, and when to consider using it.

---

## 📌 What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM (like Lamini's) and training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This helps the model specialize in a particular type of data, language, or behavior.

Instead of training a model from scratch (which is expensive and slow), fine-tuning adapts a powerful base model to your specific needs — quickly and cost-effectively.

## 💡 Why Use Lamini for Fine-Tuning?

Lamini provides a **developer-first platform** to easily fine-tune LLMs **without deep ML expertise**. You get:

- ✅ Easy API for uploading data and training
- ✅ Transparent control over training parameters
- ✅ Model hosting & evaluation tools built-in
- ✅ Support for safety, alignment, and filtering
- ✅ No need to manage GPUs, scaling, or infrastructure

---

## 🚀 When Should You Fine-Tune?

Consider fine-tuning if:

- You have repetitive queries or tasks
- Base model gives generic or incorrect responses
- You want the LLM to match your domain tone/style
- You’re working on tasks like:
  - Support ticket auto-replies
  - Domain-specific Q&A (e.g. legal, medical)
  - Internal document summarization
  - Custom instruction following
